# LegalUplifter

Minimal Vite + React app repository. This README provides quick instructions to run the project locally.

Requirements
- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm)

Quick start

```bash
# from repository root
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Notes
- `node_modules/` is intentionally ignored by `.gitignore`. Do not commit installed dependencies.
- `package-lock.json` is kept in the repo for reproducible installs.

If you want, add a LICENSE and CI workflow next.
